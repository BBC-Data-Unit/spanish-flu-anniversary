In September 2018 the data unit analysed archives from the Wellcome Library to [show the impact of the Spanish Flu pandemic a century earlier](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45097068).

The BBC England data unit analysed medical officers' reports for various English towns that had been digitised by the Wellcome Library in order to find out how many deaths were specifically attributed to influenza in 1918 and 1919.

Where possible we also gave the overall number of deaths recorded but the way in which individual officers recorded their statistics varied from area to area.

## Get the data

The data was compiled manually from scanned documents from 1918 and 1919 such as [this one](https://wellcomelibrary.org/item/b29524982#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=7&z=-0.4803%2C-0.03%2C1.9517%2C1.0699).
